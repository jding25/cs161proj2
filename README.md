Secure File Sharing System

The client will be written in Golang and will allow users to take the following actions:

- Authenticate with a username and password;
- Save files to the server;
- Load saved files from the server;
- Overwrite saved files on the server;
- Append to saved files on the server;
- Share saved files with other users; and
- Revoke access to previously shared files.

Implementation is in `client.go`, and tests are in `client_test.go`.
